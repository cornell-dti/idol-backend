    "about": "I'm currently a sophomore in AEM concentrating in Finance and Business Analytics. In the future, I hope to enter either the consulting or sports analytics field. Besides DTI, I am involved in Cornell Economics Society, Men's Club Volleyball, and Lambdas! On any day, you can probably find me procrastinating in eHub or not following my gym schedule.",
