    "about": "Hey, I'm Cedric and I'm a senior information science major. I joined DTI as a designer on cue, our events app, sophomore year. Fast forward to the end of junior year, I was given the privilege of joining the leads team to head our design initiatives. Over the past two summers, I've spent my time at a startup designing for growth at Concord, a contract success platform, and understanding how marketing teams utilize data visualizations as part of Facebook's connectivity branch. My moodboard consists of (and is pretty much limited to) ordering oat lattes, shopping at uniqlo, and pretending to listen to music on my airpods.",
