    "about": "Hi! I’m Vladia. I am an Operations Research major with a minor in Computer Science. On DTI, I hope to make a positive impact on Cornell and its surrounding community through engineering. Here, I’m also a member of Alpha Phi Omega, and tutor middle schoolers in Ithaca. I love to travel and explore new places almost as much as I enjoy staying home and drinking hot tea. In my free time, you can catch me watching Grey’s Anatomy, getting Korean food in collegetown, or face-timing my dog.",
