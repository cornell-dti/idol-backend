Aside from DTI, I am also a member of the Cornell Undergraduate Asia Business Society and student representative for the Singapore Students’ Association. I’m interested in all things technology and strategy, and how organisations can work to raise the triple bottom line. Catch me honing my foosball skills at Okenshields, playing badminton or watching Masterchef while drinking copious amounts of bubble tea!",
