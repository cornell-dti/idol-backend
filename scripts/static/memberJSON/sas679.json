I’m a maker at heart, and have always been fascinated with the intersection of design, technology, and business. When I’m not in Duffield doing homework, you can find me hanging out with friends at the gorges, watching sy-fy movies, performing stand-up comedy at open mics, and eating acai bowls at Chatty Cathy.",
