    "about": "Hi! I'm a Computer Science sophomore minoring in Cognitive Science and Game Design. Aside from my work in DTI, I work on research that applies unsupervised learning to the development of common-sense reasoning in humans. I also volunteer at ACSU and Esports at Cornell's events. In every activity I do on campus, I love learning about other people and welcoming new students! My goals at Cornell are to learn more about the psychology of gaming and technology, to grow as a person, and to have fun! When I have time to burn, I'm playing video games, skiing, and making memes.",
