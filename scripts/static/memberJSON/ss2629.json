    "about": "I'm an aspiring product/UX designer and I hope to make a positive, social impact through the field of design. Besides designing, I love all things music and dance! On campus, I am a member of Cornell Anjali, an Indian classical dance team, and a member of Fort√© Campus at Cornell, a professional business organization. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places to eat and drink coffee, finding fun things to take pictures of, and learning how to play my favorite songs on the piano.",
