    "about": "I'm an avid developer who loves seeing software used to solve problems in the world. I'm also intrigued by the idea of Smart Cities and using the Internet of Things to improve our current infrastructures. I've previously worked at BuzzFeed and PubNub as a SWE. Besides that I love exploring nature, doing pretty much anything spontaneous, traveling, listening to music and dropping my own fire mixtapes on Souncloud.",
