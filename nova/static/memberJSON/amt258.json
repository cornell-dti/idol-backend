    "about": "When Iâ€™m not hiking up the slope to get to class, I enjoy singing and playing music. Also, I have a crazy good memory and can remember almost everything down to the smallest detail. And even though I grew up very accustomed to the warm California sunshine, I actually find the winters in Ithaca very enjoyable."
